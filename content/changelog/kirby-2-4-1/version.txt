## Toolkit

- Fixed double-obfuscation of email addresses
- (toolkit: str/slug) now accepts an empty string as separator.
- Fixed collection sorting for Cyrillic and Korean languages. 
- Option for (toolkit: html/attr) to pass attributes which will not be escaped automatically: 
    ```php
    html::attr([
      'unescaped' => [
        'value'  => 'my unescaped attribute',
        'escape' => false
      ]  
    ]);
    ```
- Allow custom session fingerprinting to avoid session invalidation in environments, where IP addresses or User Agents change often.
  ```php
  s::$fingerprint = function() {
      return 'custom fingerprint';
  }
  ```
