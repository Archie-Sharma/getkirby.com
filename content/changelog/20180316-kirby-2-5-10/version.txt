## Panel

- Fixed an issue that would break sorting pages or images if there were more than 8 siblings (at least 10 items in total) [#1138](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/1138)

## Kirby

- Updated Parsedown to 1.7.1

## Toolkit

- The (toolkit: collection/sort-by) method now defaults to the `SORT_REGULAR` flag of PHP's `array_multisort()` function again to ensure compatibility [#1138](https://github.com/getkirby/panel/issues/1138)
