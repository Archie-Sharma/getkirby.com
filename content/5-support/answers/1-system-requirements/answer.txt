Title: What are the system requirements for Kirby

----

Text:

Kirby runs on PHP 5.4+, Apache 2 or nginx. Lighthttpd should be doable but is not officially supported.

Kirby has been successfully tested on MAMP, XAMPP and PHP's built-in server for local installations.

Kirby is not compatible with IIS.

The Kirby Panel works great with any modern browser starting with Internet Explorer 10.
