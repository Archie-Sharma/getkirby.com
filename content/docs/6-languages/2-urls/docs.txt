Title: Translating URLs

----

Description: Learn how to translate the URLs for pages in all available languages.

Text:

Kirby helps you to create nice URLs for all your pages.

```
http://yourdomain.com/projects/project-a
```

Such URLs are readable for your visitors as well as for search engines.

But when you are working with a multi-language site project you will be facing the problem, that those URLs should somehow be translatable.

```
http://yourdomain.com/projekte/projekt-a
```

When multiple languages are activated for your site you can add an additional `URL-Key` field to translated content files, to translate the foldername of a page.

Here's a quick example – English is the default language:

#### content/projects/projects.en.txt

    title: My Title
    ----
    text: This is the text for the projects page

#### content/projects/projects.de.txt

    title: Mein Titel
    ----
    URL-Key: projekte
    ----
    text: Das ist der Text für die Projekt Seite

The URL for the English translation will be:

```
http://yourdomain.com/en/projects
```

and the URL for the German translation will be:

```
http://yourdomain.com/de/projekte
```

You don't need to add `URL-Key` to your text files for your default language. Kirby will take the folder name in that case.
