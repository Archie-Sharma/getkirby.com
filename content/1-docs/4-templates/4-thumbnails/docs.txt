Title: Thumbnails

Text:

Kirby's built-in thumbnail class lets you resize and crop any image from your content folder on the fly. 

## The thumb function

Any image in your content folder can be passed to Kirby's `thumb()` function, which is available in all templates, snippets, controllers and plugin files. 

### Example:

```php
echo thumb($page->image('cover.jpg'), array('width' => 300));
```


## Resizing images

### By width

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300));
```

### By height

```php
echo thumb($image, array('height' => 300));
```

### By width and height

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300, 'height' => 200));
```

#### Shorthand

Since Kirby Version 2.2, you can also use the shorthand `resize()` method. Checkout the Cheat Sheet at http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/file/resize

## Cropping images

### Squares

If you specify just the width, the thumb function will crop the image into a 300 x 300 square.

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300, 'crop' => true));
```

### By width and height

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300, 'height' => 400, 'crop' => true));
```

<since v="2.2">
#### Shorthand

Since Kirby version 2.2, you can also use the shorthand `crop()` method. Check out the Cheat Sheet at http://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/file/crop

## Setting the quality

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300, 'quality' => 80));
```

## Blurring

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300, 'blur' => true));
```

## Grayscale

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 300, 'grayscale' => true));
```

## Using thumb class methods

You can either echo the `thumb()` result to generate the thumbnail and auto-create an HTML image tag for it. But you can also access a set of methods of the thumbnail class instead:

```php
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 400, 'height' => 250))->url();
// return width of the thumb
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 400, 'height' => 250))->width();
// return height of the thumb
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 400, 'height' => 250))->height();
// return file size of the thumb
echo thumb($image, array('width' => 400, 'height' => 250))->niceSize();
```

The `thumb()` method returns a Kirby Media object. For a full set of available options, please check out the (link: docs/toolkit/api#media text: Media object docs).

## Thumbs for files outside the content folder

The `thumb()` function expects a Kirby Media object in order to work correctly. Images inside the content folder, fetched by the Kirby API are extended Media objects by default, so you don't have to care about anything when using them. But if you want to pass your own image files from outside the content folder, you need to convert them to a so-called Asset object first, which is fortunately very easy to do: 

```php
// pass a relative URI from the root of your site
$myimage = new Asset('assets/images/myimage.jpg');

echo thumb($myimage, array('width' => 300));
```
