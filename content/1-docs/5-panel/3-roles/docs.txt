Text:

Kirby's user management is based on a simple role system. By default, Kirby is configured to provide two roles:

- Admin
- Editor

Roles can be assigned to the users in the Users section of the Panel.

The Admin role is mandatory and cannot be removed. Users with that role have all permissions, while editors are by default only allowed to edit their own user profile, but not create, modify or delete other users.

<since v="2.4.0">
## Creating your own roles

You can create your own roles in the `site/roles` directory.
Each role gets its own PHP file, like `site/roles/editor.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
  'name'        => 'Editor',
  'default'     => false,
  'permissions' => [
    ...
  ]
];
```

### name option

The `name` option sets the human-readable name of the role. It is displayed in the role select field on the user forms in the Panel.

### default option

The `default` option determines which role is being selected by default when a new user is being created.
Only one role can be the default.

### permissions option

The `permissions` option allows you to control the permissions (in the Panel or for plugin functions) of all users with the role. (link: docs/panel/permissions text: Learn more about permissions.)
