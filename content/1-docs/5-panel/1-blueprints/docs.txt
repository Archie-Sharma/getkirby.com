Blueprints are the counterpart of each of your templates. They create individual forms in the Panel which make it easy to insert the required data. Blueprints offer a wide set of options to customize those forms and even provide help to Panel users while they enter data.

Blueprints are defined in YAML. This is how a typical blueprint looks like:
