## Page preview

The sidebar for each page contains a link, which will take panel users to the corresponding page. Sometimes it makes sense to reroute this link or hide it entirely.

### Rerouting the preview link

In Kirby it's often useful to add subpages as data providers instead of real pages. A typical example would be a one-pager with subpages for each section or a contact page with multiple addresses, which are fed by subpages. In such a case the preview link should lead to the parent page and not to the subpage.

For scenarios like this you have three available options to reroute the preview link:

#### Parent

The preview link will lead to the parent page.

```
…
preview: parent
…
```

#### First child

The preview link will lead to the first subpage of the current page.

```
…
preview: first-child
…
```

#### Last child

The preview link will lead to the last subpage of the current page.

```
…
preview: last-child
…
```

### Hiding the preview link

The preview link can also be switched off entirely. In this case it will not be shown in the sidebar at all.

```
…
preview: false
…
```

## Prevent page deletion

By default pages can be deleted in the panel. In some cases you may want to protect important pages from deletion.

This setting will prevent panel users from deleting pages that use this blueprint:

```
…
deletable: false
…
```

Even when deleting is enabled, a page with subpages cannot be deleted. You have to delete its subpages first.

## Set custom icon

You can set a custom icon for pages that will be shown in the sidebar. You can reference all Fontawesome icons by their name without "fa-".

```
…
icon: suitcase
…
```
<since v="2.3.0">

## Hide page

Since Kirby 2.3.0 you can hide a page from the panel:

```
…
hide: true
…
```
</since>
