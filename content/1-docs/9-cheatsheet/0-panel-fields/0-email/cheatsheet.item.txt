Title: Email

Excerpt:

An email input field with autocompletion and validation

----

Text:

The email field provides the most comfortable way to insert email addresses. It comes with autocompletion of addresses from all registered users and also has built-in validation for entered addresses.

## Example

```
fields:
  email:
    label: Email
    type: email
```

### Example with switched off autocompletion

```
fields:
  email:
    label: Email
    type: email
    autocomplete: false
```

## In your templates

You can simply echo the value of your email field in your templates  like this:

```
<?= $page->email() ?>
```

However, if you want to make use of Kirby's built-in email obfuscation, you have several options:

Using `html::email()`:

```php
<?= html::email($page->email()) ?>
```

Using `str::encode()`:

```php
<a href="mailto:<?= str::encode($page->email()) ?>">
    <?= str::encode($page->email()) ?>
</a>
````

Using the `kirbytag()` helper:

```php
<?= kirbytag([
      'email'  => $page->email(),
      'text'  => 'Contact us'
    ]);
?>
```
